# CSC212-Project-1
This is Nathaniel Brown and Rebecca Iselin's Project 1 repository.

Within it you will find various versions of our gradebook program; the finalized ready for grading version is within the Finished Project folder. 
There you will find the main.cpp, gradebook.cpp, and gradebook.h files. These will be used to compile and run our program. For instructions on compiling and using our program; look within the project 211 report pdf file. If you wish to view a pdf of our spreadsheet detailing member contribution; open the pdf labeled member contribution. 

When compiling our program; make sure to have downloaded one or all of the 3 .txt files within the Finished Project folder.

Thanks.
